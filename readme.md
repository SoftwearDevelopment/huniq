# huniq

Simplified version of the uniq(1) tool, that uses a hash
table internally to remove and count duplicates.

# usage

  `$ huniq [-c|--count] [-h|--help] < FILE > FILE`

-c and --count can be used to indicate that duplicate elements should be
counted.
-h and --help will display this help page

# why?

This is useful for replacing the `sort | uniq -c` pattern
in cases where the input is very large (larger than ram)
but the uniqed output is mach smaller:

The sort step above needs to load the entire input data into
memory, so the amount of memory is roughly equal to the size
of the input data. huniq already deduplicates the data in
memory, so it's memory requirement is roughly equal to that
of the deduped output.

Note that huniq generally has no advantage to just using
`uniq` without the sort, since uniq just removes consecutive
duplicates so it just needs to keep a single line in memory.

huniq returns the input data in arbitrary order.

# building

Just type `make`. Move the resulting binary to a place of
your choosing in order to install.
