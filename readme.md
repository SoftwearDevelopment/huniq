# huniq

Simplified version of the basic usages ofuniq(1) and sort(1),
that uses a hash table internally to remove and count duplicates.

# usage

  `$ huniq [-c|--count] [-h|--help] < FILE > FILE`

-c and --count can be used to indicate that duplicate elements should be
counted.
-h and --help will display this help page

# why?

This is useful for replacing the `sort | uniq -c`, `sort | uniq` or `sort -u`
in cases where sorting is not required.

`huniq -c` and `huniq` are both generally faster and use less memory than
their counterparts, this is achieved by using a couple of optimizations:

A hash table is used to store duplicates instead of sorting the input;
this increases performance, since hashing is usually faster than sorting.
It also means that duplicates do not have to be stored individually (they
all occupy the same hash bucket), so the memory requirements grow with the
size of the output and not the input. E.g. if each line in the input has a
one duplicate at average, we need 50% less memory.

`huniq` also does not store the actual lines themselves, instead it just stores
a hash value (16 byte each) of that line. This is especially very useful when very
long lines are in the input.

`huniq` outputs lines in the order they where given, while `huniq -c` returns lines
in arbitrary order.

huniq does not swap data to disk like gnu sort does, so for that reason it sometimes
also uses more memory than sort, especially when there are many items and not many duplicates.

Note that huniq generally has no advantage to just using
`uniq` without the sort, since uniq just removes consecutive
duplicates so it just needs to keep a single line in memory.

# building

Download the submodules (`git submodule init && git submodule update`)
and then just type `make`. Move the resulting binary to a place of
your choosing in order to install.
